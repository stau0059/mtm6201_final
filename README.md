Note: I am not a vegetarian so it was difficult for me to come up with the specific photos I wanted for this project. I decided to use stock photos.

Chatgpt

I used https://chatgpt.com to generate a logo for Plant Palette based on my ideas.**

I prompted https://chatgpt.com to help generate blurbs for menu items**

Color Scheme

I started with the colors documented and decided that they were not contrasting enough. I wanted the website to be as accessible as possible so I played around with different shades/ hues and finally landed on the colors #7c77e0 and #3E9035. I wanted the website to have a light and organic feel to it while also keeping it professional looking. 

Forms

Learning how to layout forms with Bootstrap was probably the most challenging portion of this project for me. I am happy with the final product though they do have a different look from my hi-fi wireframes. 

Menu

It took some time to find the perfect photos for the menu. I thought about the customer and how they would want a variety of vegetarian/ vegan dishes to choose from. If I were to add more to the Menu page I would add options to shop online and also give more details about the dishes and add icons to show which are gluten-free, vegan etc. 

What I enjoyed

Bootstrap allows me to easily adjust for all screen sizes. Once I got the hang of using the grid layout through Bootstrap I was able to easily space my content on each page.
